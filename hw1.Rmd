##### **Q3.**
The job of a data scientist would be to get data and make the most efficient use of it to predict the future. For instance, a recent research topic, **predictive machine maintenance** is something a data scientist could do (and interests me as well). The idea is to collect data from machines (atleast 2yrs) and effectively use it to predict when it needs a maintenance/service or when it could fail.

*You could read more about predictive maintenance [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance)*
